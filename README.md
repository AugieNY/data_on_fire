# Credit Card Segmentation and Churn Prediction

Final Group Project:

Fatima Benitez, Jennifer Barrios, Alberto Aigner, Augustin Bourgois, Will Siuta

## Introduction
Predicting customer churn is a challenge for businesses with large customer bases who may not have a one-to-one relationship with them. It is therefore critical to collect and store data on each unique customer in order to analyze their characteristics and determine what the commonalities are among loyal customers and those who leave. Furthermore, implementing machine learning techniques enables companies to automate the analysis and make more efficient predictions.

As a group, we all wanted to confront this common business challenge for which we could potentially replicate its solution in the real world across our respective fields.

## Dataset and Source
The data used for this project was pulled from a notebook created by the profile named “AMAN CHAUHAN” on Kaggle.com It consists of a unique customer list from a credit card company and their characteristics which include: 
* Which credit card type they are using by name.
* Their status as an existing or attrited customer.
* How long they have or were customers for.
* Demographic information.
* Spending habits.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To perform our EDA, we imported our dataset into a Google Colab notebook and created a DataFrame from the BankChurners.csv file:

## Analysis
Questions aimed to answer with the data:

**GENERAL / BIG PICTURE**

* What are the credit card categories?
* What is the average LTV for all customers?
* What is the average months on book for all customers?
* What is the credit limit for each credit card category?
* How many customers for each credit card category?

<br>*Credit Card Category Split:*
* Total number of existing and attrited customers for each card category
* What is the average number of months on book for each card category?
