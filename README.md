# Credit Card Segmentation and Churn Prediction

Final Group Project:

Fatima Benitez, Jennifer Barrios, Alberto Aigner, Augustin Bourgois, Will Siuta

## Introduction
Predicting customer churn is a challenge for businesses with large customer bases who may not have a one-to-one relationship with them. It is therefore critical to collect and store data on each unique customer in order to analyze their characteristics and determine what the commonalities are among loyal customers and those who leave. Furthermore, implementing machine learning techniques enables companies to automate the analysis and make more efficient predictions.

As a group, we all wanted to confront this common business challenge for which we could potentially replicate its solution in the real world across our respective fields.
